# Logger

 Logger is a middleware that will log to the console all parameters passed to the server via different
  methods of inputting data from a web app to the server (form, URL, etc). 
  For example, if the URL was http://localhost:8000/weather?name=foo it would log the fact that the name=foo was passed.

 Log requests HTTP requests and its parameters to the console.

  Examples:
     
     var logger = require('./logger');

     router.use('/',logger);
